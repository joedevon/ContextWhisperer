ideas:
- Add interactive prompts in general like the one we did already for cross cutting concerns
- add an interactive prompt for LLM conversation patterns like https://x.com/heyDhavall/status/1904447094456451508
- come up with an easy way to allow users to customize this repo, but still run a terminal command to update the repo. For example, the base prompts live in one place, but we provide a custom space for the user to customize or add their own prompts that won't get overwritten when the user runs `git pull`.
