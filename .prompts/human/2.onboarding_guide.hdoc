Create a comprehensive onboarding guide for new developers that:

ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:
- Include ONLY setup instructions that are confirmed by configuration files in the codebase
- Reference REAL project structure with exact file paths using "filename:line" format
- Document ACTUAL workflows and processes as demonstrated in the code or CI/CD configuration
- DO NOT include hypothetical tools or processes not evident in the codebase
- If any part of the development workflow is unclear from the code, explicitly state "No code evidence for this process"
- Base all examples on existing patterns found in the codebase

1. Provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the development environment
2. Explains the project structure and organization
3. Outlines the development workflow (branching strategy, PR process, etc.)
4. Documents coding standards and conventions
5. Walks through a simple example task from start to finish
6. Lists common gotchas and how to avoid them
7. Includes references to key resources and documentation

STRUCTURE FORMAT:
Follow the scaffold.template guidance for documentation structure:
- Use the standard document structure format specified in the template
- Organize information in a logical progression from setup to advanced usage
- Include practical examples with file references

The guide should be approachable for newcomers while providing sufficient technical detail.
Use a friendly, instructional tone with clear examples and explanations.

Save the output as "onboarding_guide.md" in "docs/ai-generated/". 

PREFERENCES:
- Follow all settings in the preferences.config file for formatting, environment, and style choices
- Use terminal command formats based on the shell specified in preferences
- Match the specified code style preferences for any code snippets
- Adhere to the documentation style and content preferences
