Generate a comprehensive architecture overview document that:

ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:
- Base all information EXCLUSIVELY on evidence found in the codebase
- DO NOT include components, patterns or flows that cannot be directly verified in the code
- If uncertain about any aspect, clearly mark it as "Potentially Missing Information" rather than guessing
- For any architectural decisions, cite specific file locations that demonstrate the implementation
- Use the format "filename:line" when referencing specific code evidence

1. Explains the high-level system architecture with clear diagrams (described in markdown)
2. Details the key components and their responsibilities
3. Illustrates how data flows through the system
4. Documents significant architectural decisions and their rationales
5. Describes key design patterns used and why they were chosen
6. Outlines technical constraints and how they shaped the architecture

Include both conceptual (what and why) and structural (how) aspects of the architecture.
Use clear headings, diagrams, and examples that aid human understanding.

Save the output as "architecture_overview.md" in "docs/ai-generated/". 

PREFERENCES:
- Follow all settings in the preferences.config file for formatting, environment, and style choices
- Use terminal command formats based on the shell specified in preferences
- Match the specified code style preferences for any code snippets
- Adhere to the documentation style and content preferences
