Create a practical onboarding guide that helps developers get started:

ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:
- Base all information on verifiable code evidence
- Focus on getting developers productive quickly
- Mark uncertainties as "Potentially Missing Information"

1. Quick Start:
   - Prerequisites from package files
   - Basic setup steps
   - Minimal configuration needed
   - First run/test verification

2. Development Setup:
   - Environment setup from config files
   - Required dependencies
   - Development tools (if specified)
   - Local build process

3. Project Structure:
   - Key directories and their purpose
   - Important configuration files
   - Where to find tests
   - Where to find documentation

4. Development Workflows (if present):
   - How to run locally
   - How to run tests
   - How to build/package
   - Common development tasks



Make the guide practical and focused on getting started quickly.
Prioritize information needed for immediate productivity.

OUTPUTS:
1. Save the main document as "onboarding_doc.md" in "docs/ai-generated/"
2. Save any diagrams as separate .dot files in "docs/diagrams/"

PREFERENCES:
- Follow all settings in the preferences.config file for formatting, environment, and style choices
- Use terminal command formats based on the shell specified in preferences
- Match the specified code style preferences for any code snippets
- Adhere to the documentation style and content preferences
