Create a comprehensive troubleshooting guide that will help developers diagnose and resolve common issues:

ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:
- Include ONLY issues that can be verified from actual code, tests, or configuration files
- For each issue, provide EXACT file references where the problem may occur using "filename:line" format
- Use REAL error messages copied directly from the codebase, not fabricated ones
- DO NOT include hypothetical problems without evidence in the code
- If knowledge is incomplete in any area, explicitly state "No code evidence found for this issue"
- Include executable code examples that match the project's actual syntax and conventions

1. Identify common error scenarios, bugs, and challenges
2. For each issue, document:
   - Symptoms and error messages
   - Possible causes
   - Step-by-step troubleshooting process
   - Solutions with code examples where appropriate
   - Prevention strategies
3. Include sections for:
   - Development environment issues
   - Build and deployment problems
   - Runtime errors
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Testing challenges
4. Add a "Lessons Learned" section with architectural insights gained from past issues

Make the guide practical and action-oriented.
Use a problem→diagnosis→solution format that's easy to follow.

Save the output as "troubleshooting_guide.md" in "docs/ai-generated/". 

PREFERENCES:
- Follow all settings in the preferences.config file for formatting, environment, and style choices
- Use terminal command formats based on the shell specified in preferences
- Match the specified code style preferences for any code snippets
- Adhere to the documentation style and content preferences
