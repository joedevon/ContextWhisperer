Create practical component documentation that:

ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:
- Base all information on verifiable code evidence
- Focus on how components are used rather than implementation details
- Mark uncertainties as "Potentially Missing Information"

1. Core Components:
   - Main purpose and responsibility
   - How to use the component
   - Configuration options
   - Common usage patterns

2. Entry Point Components (if present):
   - Command-line components
   - API endpoints/handlers
   - User interface components
   - Public interfaces/APIs

3. Supporting Components:
   - Utilities and helpers
   - Shared services
   - Data structures

4. Component Interactions:
   - Dependencies between components
   - Data flow
   - Configuration requirements

For each component category:
- Document primary use cases
- Show example usage
- List configuration options
- Note any limitations

Make the documentation practical and example-driven.
Focus on helping developers use the components effectively.

OUTPUTS:
1. Save the main document as "components_doc.md" in "docs/ai-generated/"
2. Save any diagrams as separate .dot files in "docs/diagrams/"

PREFERENCES:
- Follow all settings in the preferences.config file for formatting, environment, and style choices
- Use terminal command formats based on the shell specified in preferences
- Match the specified code style preferences for any code snippets
- Adhere to the documentation style and content preferences
