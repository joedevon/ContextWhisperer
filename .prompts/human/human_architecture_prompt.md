Generate a comprehensive architecture overview document that:

ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:
- Base all information on verifiable code evidence
- Mark uncertainties as "Potentially Missing Information"
- Output diagrams as separate .dot files in docs/diagrams

1. Explains the high-level system architecture
2. Details the key components and their responsibilities
3. Illustrates how data flows through the system
4. Documents significant architectural decisions and their rationales
5. Outlines technical constraints and their impact

Include both conceptual (what and why) and structural (how) aspects of the architecture.
Use clear headings and examples that aid human understanding.

OUTPUTS:
1. Save the main document as "architecture_doc.md" in "docs/ai-generated/"
2. Save diagrams as separate .dot files in "docs/diagrams/"
3. Create a project-tree.txt in "docs/tree/" that shows the key components and structure

PREFERENCES:
- Follow all settings in the preferences.config file for formatting, environment, and style choices
- Use terminal command formats based on the shell specified in preferences
- Match the specified code style preferences for any code snippets
- Adhere to the documentation style and content preferences
