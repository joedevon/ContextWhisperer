Create a practical troubleshooting guide based on verifiable issues:

ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:
- Include ONLY issues found in tests, error handling, or logs
- Base solutions on actual code patterns
- Mark uncertainties as "Potentially Missing Information"

1. Common Issues (from error handling):
   - Error patterns in the code
   - Built-in error messages
   - Standard error cases
   - Recovery procedures

2. Development Issues (if present in tests):
   - Build/compilation problems
   - Test failures
   - Configuration issues
   - Environment setup problems

3. Runtime Issues (from error handling):
   - Known error conditions
   - Exception handling
   - Resource issues
   - Recovery steps

4. Debugging Guide:
   - Available debug tools
   - Logging configuration
   - Common debug workflows
   - Where to find logs

Make the guide practical and solution-focused.
Prioritize common issues with clear solutions.

OUTPUTS:
1. Save the main document as "troubleshooting_doc.md" in "docs/ai-generated/"
2. Save any diagrams as separate .dot files in "docs/diagrams/"

PREFERENCES:
- Follow all settings in the preferences.config file for formatting, environment, and style choices
- Use terminal command formats based on the shell specified in preferences
- Match the specified code style preferences for any code snippets
- Adhere to the documentation style and content preferences
