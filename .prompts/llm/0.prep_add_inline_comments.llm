Analyze the codebase and ADD (never modify or delete) minimal inline comments in areas that lack sufficient context:
- Complex algorithms or data transformations that aren't self-documenting
- Key architectural decision points or patterns that affect multiple components
- Non-obvious dependencies or side effects
- Critical business logic that requires domain knowledge

CONSTRAINTS:
- Never modify or delete existing comments
- Only add comments where clarity is genuinely needed
- Keep added comments minimal and AI-focused
- Skip areas that are already well-documented or self-explanatory 

ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:
- Base all comments ONLY on clear evidence from the code
- DO NOT speculate about implementation details not present in the code
- If uncertain about functionality, use phrasing like "Appears to..." rather than definitive statements
- Avoid commenting on code purpose unless the intent is obvious from the implementation
- Comments should explain WHAT and WHY, not restate HOW the code works
