Analyze how cross-cutting concerns are actually implemented in the codebase:

1. For each concern in `llm.yaml`, document the actual implementation:
   - Error handling patterns used
   - Logging implementation details
   - Environment variable management
   - Authentication approaches
   - API response formats
   - Testing patterns

2. Look for additional cross-cutting patterns:
   - Repeated code patterns across modules
   - Shared utilities or helpers
   - Common architectural approaches
   - Standardized file structures

3. For each identified pattern:
   - Document where it's used (filename:line)
   - Note any variations in implementation
   - Identify inconsistencies across the codebase
   - Flag deviations from `llm.yaml` preferences

ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:
- Document ONLY patterns that exist in the actual code
- Include specific file references for each pattern
- Note any missing implementations of `llm.yaml` preferences
- Highlight inconsistencies between modules
- DO NOT assume implementations without code evidence

Focus on actual implementation details an LLM needs to maintain consistency.
