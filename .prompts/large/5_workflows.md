# Large Codebase Workflow Analysis

## Purpose
Final phase of large codebase analysis, documenting key workflows, processes, and operational patterns across the system.

## Token Limits
- Maximum per generated file: 4000 tokens
- Recommended split point: 3500 tokens
- Expected number of context files: 3-5

## Analysis Instructions

1. **Business Workflows**
   - Map primary use cases
   - Document business processes
   - Identify critical paths
   - Note decision points

2. **Technical Workflows**
   - Analyze deployment flows
   - Document build processes
   - Map data pipelines
   - Note maintenance procedures

3. **Cross-System Processes**
   - Document integration workflows
   - Map distributed processes
   - Identify async flows
   - Note recovery procedures

4. **Output Format**

Generate a workflows.md file containing:

```markdown
# System Workflows

## Business Processes
[Document key business workflows]

## Technical Processes
[Map system operations]

## Integration Workflows
[Describe cross-system processes]

## Operational Procedures
[Document maintenance workflows]

## Error Handling
[Map recovery processes]
```

5. **Final Integration**
   - Connect to architectural patterns
   - Link to core components
   - Reference integration points
   - Note performance implications

## Constraints
- Focus on end-to-end flows
- Include sequence diagrams
- Document error handling
- Note performance considerations
